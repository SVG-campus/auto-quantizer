Auto-Quantizer: Proof of Concept
This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) for an Auto-Quantizer, a tool designed to automatically compress large language models (LLMs) to reduce inference costs (latency, memory) with minimal impact on accuracy.

The goal of this POC is to demonstrate significant, reproducible cost savings on standard open-source models like Mistral-7B, creating a compelling case for commercial licensing and further development.

Project Phases
Phase 1: Kaggle-Scale Proof of Concept (Current)

Objective: Build a working script that demonstrably reduces model size and latency.

Deliverables:

This open-source POC script (auto_quantizer.py).

A public benchmark report comparing original vs. compressed models.

A polished demo web app (app.py) to showcase the "drop-in shrink" capability.

Phase 2: Expansion & Hardening

Objective: Add more advanced compression techniques and expand model support.

Tasks:

Implement Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), Pruning (Magnitude & Structured), and Knowledge Distillation.

Integrate ONNX Runtime and NVIDIA TensorRT for production-grade inference speedups.

Automate benchmarking across a wider range of models and hardware (e.g., A10, T4).

Getting Started
1. Environment Setup
This project is designed to run in environments like Kaggle or Google Colab, which provide access to GPUs.

a. Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Auto-Quantizer-POC.git](https://github.com/your-username/Auto-Quantizer-POC.git)
cd Auto-Quantizer-POC

b. Install dependencies:
It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. How to Run the Quantizer Script
The core logic is in auto_quantizer.py. It loads a specified HuggingFace model, applies Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), and reports the performance trade-offs.

Example Usage:
The following command will load Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, quantize it to 4-bit, and print a comparison report.

python auto_quantizer.py \
    --model_id "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2" \
    --quantization_method "4-bit"

3. How to Run the Demo App
The Gradio demo provides an interactive way to see the effects of quantization.

python app.py

Navigate to the local URL provided by Gradio (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:7860) to use the app.

Core Technical Stack
Models: LLaMA family, Mistral family, and other open variants from HuggingFace.

Libraries:

PyTorch: Core deep learning framework.

HuggingFace Transformers: For loading and managing models.

bitsandbytes: For easy and effective Post-Training Quantization (4-bit/8-bit).

accelerate: To properly load large models across available hardware.

safetensors: For safe and fast model weight serialization.

Gradio: For building the interactive web demo.

Next Steps & Monetization Path
Generate Benchmark Report: Run the script on the top 10 target models (start with Llama-3 8B, Mistral-7B, Phi-3) and fill out the benchmark_report_template.md.

Publish Results: Convert the report to a blog post or PDF. Create a short demo video of the Gradio app in action.

Outreach: Share the repository, report, and demo with target engineers at AI startups and enterprise AI groups. The key message is simple: ">40% cost reduction with <2% metric drop."

Engage: Use the strong, reproducible results to start conversations about consulting pilots or early licensing agreements.
